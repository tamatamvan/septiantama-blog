"Hi! How are you?"
That's one of the things I wanna say.
 I wish I could say it to you,
but I just being a coward as usual . . .

_"Hi! How are you?"_ <br/>
That's one of the things I wanna say <br/>
I wish I could say it to you <br/>
But I just being a coward as usual <br/>

It's been a long time, isn't it? <br/>
When is the last time we met? <br/>
Suddenly your selfie appears on InstaStory <br/>
You don't seem to change <br/>
That brings back our memories <br/>
Would you like to talk about it? <br/>

But you're not that kind of person, aren't you? <br/>
You always keep moving forward <br/>
While I still love to look back at our past <br/>
and still looking at your photographs (oops) <br/>

Don't get me wrong, I'm already moved on <br/>
But I won't lie, there are times when I miss you <br/>
After all, our story is also part of me <br/>
It's one of the things that made me <br/>

Ah, and anyway, I'm doing well and healthy <br/>
I hope you too! <br/>
